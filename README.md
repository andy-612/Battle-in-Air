# Battle-in-Air
A programed arcade game that has planes hitting other planes. It's a player Vs computer game, and there is no obstacle. However, there are limited ammunitions and also the lives that a player can have in each play. The oppnonent planes, or the computers, would come out on the opposite side of the screen and fire systematically, which the player has to avoid being hit and also destroy the opponents at the same time. There are also levels, as time increases and the player is still in the game, the level goes up and it becomes harder. Extra care and boost packages will appear randomly. Extra care package provides extra help and boost packages give faster shooting speed or moving speed for a limited amount of time. The background is a motion screen so it makes the plane seem like it's moving. And there will also be a leaderboard to keep track of the highest score.
